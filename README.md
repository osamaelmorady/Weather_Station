# Weather_Station
A weather station that can show local atmospheric pressure, temperature humidity and UV index without any internet connection.


ABOUT THIS PROJECT
For a long time, I wanted to make a weather station without using the internet. It is great to measure the weather data on your surrounding and take a look at the data when wanted. so, I make a cool-looking local weather station that can measure your surrounding air pressure, temperature, humidity, and the UV index of the day (if you place it near the window). Wait it has more! ðŸ˜‰ it also has a Clock screen for showing Time, date, and day of the week.
